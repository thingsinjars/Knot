Knot
====

This is a simple proof-of-concept for a game based around the idea of tying a shape into knots. The knots are based on quadratic curves attached to a 9-tile grid so it moves predictably but not necessarily naturally. It's multi-touch enabled so you can move several different bits of the knot around simultaneously if you're on a touch device. The original concept of the game was that the single-player game would focus on discovering new patterns while the multi-player one would be a time-based challenge where each would tie a knot, pass it over to their opponent and the first to untie it would win.

Drag the sections of the string around to create new patterns. If you match an existing pattern, a message will pop up. If you invent a new one, just type a name into the box below and save it. It'll be available the next time the game loads.

Patterns to look out for: circle, square, shuriken, springbok, bon-bon, shears, fox, deer, forgotten, bison, fat cat, skunk, star, squirrel, cockateel, shield, ghost, bunny, rocketship, yoda, woodpecker, samurai. Some of them are recognised when rotated or flipped horizontally or vertically, some don't.
